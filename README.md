# [Portfolio John Morgan](https://johnny-morgan.github.io/portfolio/)

This website is my own (John Morgan) personal portfolio website. It designed to allow recruiters and hiring managers learn about
myself and to showcase my software skills. It does this by allowing potential employers to download my CV and view some of my projects.
It also provides users an option to contact me and connect via social media and LinkedIn.

The business goals of this website are:

- Build an online presence for myself.
- Showcase my software skills.
- Allow recruiters/employers to review my background and skills by providing a downloadable CV.
- Build relationships with recruiters/employers by providing contact details and social media links.

The customer goals of this website are:

- Learn about the site owners background and skills.
- View projects that the site owner has worked on.
- Have a convenient way of contacting the site owner.
- Easy navigation by providing a fixed navigation bar.

    The Roboto Condensed font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font.
    Roboto Condensed has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric but the font also features friendly and open curves.
